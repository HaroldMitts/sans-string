# sans-string
 simple python script to remove a string from a text file

 This script will prompt you what file to modify, and what string to remove from the file. It will then create a new file with the string removed.

 Yes, you can use any number of other methods to remove a string from a file, but this is a simple script that I wrote to help me remove a string from a file.
